      <p class="grey-text text-darken-4 flow-text">A service worker is a script that your browser runs in the background separate from a web page, opening the door to features that don't need a web page or user interaction. Today, they already include features like <span class="RED">push notifications</span> and <span class="RED">background sync.</span> In the future, service workers might support other things like periodic sync or geofencing.The core feature discussed in this CookBook is the ability to intercept and handle network requests, including programmatically managing a cache of responses.</p>

      <p class="grey-text text-darken-4 flow-text">The reason this is such an exciting
        <span class="RED">API</span> is that it allows you to support offline experiences, giving developers complete control over the experience.</p>
      <p
        class="grey-text text-darken-4 flow-text">Before service worker, there was one other
        <span class="RED">API</span> that gave users an offline experience on the web called AppCache. There are a number of issues with the AppCache <span class="RED">API</span> that service workers were designed to avoid.</p>

            <span>It's a JavaScript Worker, so it can't access the DOM directly. Instead, a service worker can communicate withthe pages it controls by responding to messages sent via the <span class="RED">postmessage</span> interface, and those pages can manipulate the DOM if needed.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="collapsible-body">
            <span>Service worker is a programmable network proxy, allowing you to control how network requests from your page are handled.</span>

          <div class="collapsible-body">
            <span>It's terminated when not in use, and restarted when it's next needed, so you cannot rely on global state within a service worker's <span class="RED">onfetch</span> and <span class="RED">onmessage</span> handlers.

    <div id="SWLifeCycle" class="section scrollspy">
      <p class="flow-text likeQuote" style="font-weight: 500">The Service Worker Life Cycle</p>
      <p class="grey-text text-darken-4 flow-text">A service worker has a lifecycle that is completely separate from your web page. A service worker goes through three steps in its lifecycle:</p>
      <p class="grey-text text-darken-4 flow-text" style="font-weight: bolder">Registration >> Installation >> Activation</p>
      <p class="grey-text text-darken-4 flow-text">To install a service worker for your site,you need to register it, which you do in your page's JavaScript. Registering a service worker will cause the browser to start the service worker install step in the background.</p>
      <p class="grey-text text-darken-4 flow-text">Typically during the install step, you'll want to cache some static assets. If all the files are cached successfully, then the service worker becomes installed. If any of the files fail to download and cache, then the install step will fail and the service worker won't activate (i.e. won't be installed). If that happens, don't worry, it'll try again next time. But that means if it does install, you know you've got those static assets in the cache.</p>
      <p class="grey-text text-darken-4 flow-text">When installed, the activation step will follow and this is a great opportunity for handling any management of old caches, which we'll cover during the service worker update section.</p>
      <p class="grey-text text-darken-4 flow-text">After the activation step, the service worker will control all pages that fall under its scope, though the page that registered the service worker for the first time won't be controlled until it's loaded again. Once a service worker is in control, it will be in one of two states: either the service worker will be terminated to save memory, or it will handle <span class="RED">fetch</span> and <span class="RED">message</span> events that occur when a network request or <span class="RED">message</span> is made from your page.</p>

      <p class="grey-text text-darken-4 flow-text">You can call <span class="RED">register()</span> every time a page loads without concern; the browser will figure out if the service worker is already registered or not and handle it accordingly.</p>
      <p class="grey-text text-darken-4 flow-text">One subtlety with the <span class="RED">register()</span> method is the location of the service worker file. You'll notice in this case that the service worker file is at the root of the domain. This means that the service worker's scope will be the entire origin. In other words, this service worker will receive<span class="RED">fetch</span> events for everything on this domain. If we register the service worker file at /example/sw.js, then the service worker would only see <span class="RED">fetch</span> events for pages whose URL starts with /example/ (i.e. /example/page1/, /example/page2/).</p>
      <p class="grey-text text-darken-4 flow-text">Now you can check that a service worker is enabled by going to <span class="RED">chrome://inspect/#service-workers</span> and looking for your site.</p>

This may still be useful, if for nothing more than learning about the life cycle of service workers, but don't be surprised if it gets replaced completely by <span class="RED">chrome://inspect/#service-workers</span> at a later date.</p>
      <p class="grey-text text-darken-4 flow-text">You may find it useful to test your service worker in an Incognito window so that you can close and reopen knowing that the previous service worker won't affect the new window.

      <p class="grey-text text-darken-4 flow-text">If all the files are successfully cached, then the service worker will be installed. If any of the files fail to download, then the install step will fail. This allows you to rely on having all the assets that you defined, but does mean you need to be careful with the list of files you decide to cache in the install step.

    <!--MATCH DATA-->
    <div id="matchData" class="section scrollspy">
      <p class="flow-text likeQuote" style="font-weight: 450">Match data</p>
      <p class="grey-text text-darken-4 flow-text">There are a couple of methods to search for specific content in the cache: match and matchAll. These can be called on the caches object to search through all of the existing caches, or on a specific cache returned from <span class="RED">caches.open()</span>.</p>
      <p class="grey-text text-darken-4 flow-text">
        <span class="RED">caches.match</span>(request, options) - This method returns a
        <span class="RED">Promise</span> that resolves to the response object associated with the first matching request in the cache or caches. It returns undefined if no match is found. The first parameter is the request, and the second is an optional list of options to refine the search. Here are the options as defined by MDN:</p>
      <ul class="collection">
        <li class="collection-item">
          <b>ignoreSearch:</b> A Boolean that specifies whether to ignore the query string in the URL. For example, if set to true the ?value=bar part of http://foo.com/?value=bar would be ignored when performing a match. It defaults to false.</li>
        <li class="collection-item">
          <b>ignoreMethod:</b> A Boolean that, when set to true, prevents matching operations from validating the Request HTTP method (normally only GET and HEAD are allowed.) It defaults to false.</li>
        <li class="collection-item">
          <b>ignoreVary:</b> A Boolean that when set to true tells the matching operation not to perform VARY header matching — that is, if the URL matches you will get a match regardless of whether the Response object has a VARY header. It defaults to false.</li>
        <li class="collection-item">
          <b>cacheName:</b> A DOMString that represents a specific cache to search within. Note that this option is ignored by Cache.match().</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="grey-text text-darken-4 flow-text">
        <span class="RED">caches.matchAll</span>(request, options) - This method is the same as .match except that it returns all of the matching responses from the cache instead of just the first. For example, if your app has cached some images contained in an image folder, we could return all images and perform some operation on them like this:</p>
      <ul class="collapsible popout">
        <li>
          <div class="collapsible-header light-blue lighten-5 light-blue-text text-darken-1 hoverable"> <i class="material-icons">add_circle</i>CODE:</div>
          <div class="collapsible-body black white-text">
            <span>
              <code>
              <pre>self.addEventListener('install', function(event) {
  // Perform install steps
});</pre>
</code> </span>
          </div>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!--DELETE DATA-->
    <div id="deleteData" class="section scrollspy">
      <p class="flow-text likeQuote" style="font-weight: 450">Delete data</p>
      <p class="grey-text text-darken-4 flow-text">We can delete items in the cache with <span class="RED">cache.delete</span>(request, options). This method finds the item in the cache matching the request, deletes it, and returns a <span class="RED">Promise</span> that resolves to true. If it doesn't find the item, it resolves to false. It also has the same optional options parameter available to it as the match method.</p>
    </div>
    <!--RETRIEVE KEYS-->
    <div id="retrieveKeys" class="section scrollspy">
      <p class="flow-text likeQuote" style="font-weight: 450">Retrieve keys</p>
      <p class="grey-text text-darken-4 flow-text">Finally, we can get a list of cache keys using <span class="RED">cache.keys</span>(request, options). This returns a <span class="RED">Promise</span> that resolves to an array of cache keys. These will be returned in the same order they were inserted into the cache. Both parameters are optional. If nothing is passed, <span class="RED">cache.keys</span> returns all of the requests in the cache. If a request is passed, it returns all of the matching requests from the cache. The options are the same as those in the previous methods.</p>
      <p class="grey-text text-darken-4 flow-text">The keys method can also be called on the caches entry point to return the keys for the caches themselves. This lets you purge outdated caches in one go.</p>

    <!--UPDATE A SW-->
    <div id="updateASW" class="section scrollspy">
      <p class="flow-text likeQuote" style="font-weight: 500">Update a Service Worker</p>
      <p class="grey-text text-darken-4 flow-text">There will be a point in time where your service worker will need updating. When that time comes, you'll need to follow these steps:</p>
      <ul class="collection">
        <li class="collection-item">1. Update your service worker JavaScript file. When the user navigates to your site, the browser tries to redownload the script file that defined the service worker in the background. If there is even a byte's difference in the service worker file compared to what it currently has, it considers it new.</li>
        <li class="collection-item">2. Your new service worker will be started and the install event will be fired.</li>
        <li class="collection-item">3. At this point the old service worker is still controlling the current pages so the new service worker will enter a waiting state.</li>
        <li class="collection-item">4. When the currently open pages of your site are closed the old service worker will be killed and the new service worker will take control.</li>
        <li class="collection-item">5. Once your new service worker takes control, its activate event will be fired.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="grey-text text-darken-4 flow-text">One common task that will occur in the activate callback is cache management. The reason you'll want to do this in the activate callback is because if you were to wipe out any old caches in the install step, any old service worker, which keeps control of all the current pages, will suddenly stop being able to serve files from that cache.</p>
      <p class="grey-text text-darken-4 flow-text">Let's say we have one cache called 'my-site-cache-v1', and we find that we want to split this out into one cache for pages and one cache for blog posts. This means in the install step we'd create two caches, 'pages-cache-v1' and 'blog-posts-cache-v1' and in the activate step we'd want to delete our older 'my-site-cache-v1'.</p>
      <p class="grey-text text-darken-4 flow-text">The following code would do this by looping through all of the caches in the service worker and deleting any caches that aren't defined in the cache whitelist.</p>
      <ul class="collapsible popout">
        <li>
          <div class="collapsible-header light-blue lighten-5 light-blue-text text-darken-1 hoverable"> <i class="material-icons">add_circle</i>CODE:</div>
          <div class="collapsible-body black white-text">
            <span>
              <code>
              <pre>var CACHE_NAME = 'my-site-cache-v1';
var urlsToCache = [
  '/',
  '/styles/main.css',

];

self.addEventListener('install', function(event) {
  // Perform install steps
  event.waitUntil(
    caches.open(CACHE_NAME)
      .then(function(cache) {
        console.log('Opened cache');
        return cache.addAll(urlsToCache);
      })
  );
});</pre>
